# D604-Task-2-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Neural-Networks
### Overview
This project implements sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using an LSTM neural network. It focuses on preprocessing text data, training a deep learning model, and evaluating its performance to classify reviews as positive or negative.

### Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks â€“ IMDb Movie Reviews
- Developed and trained an LSTM neural network to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, using tokenization, lemmatization, and padding to preprocess text data.
= Achieved ~76% accuracy on the test set; implemented early stopping and dropout layers to address overfitting and ensure generalization to unseen reviews.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, loss metrics, and a confusion matrix; saved the final model and included code to support reproducibility and deployment.
